# Smart Contract Verification

## Move's Approach to Smart contract verification

### Key Features

-   Focus on Security: Move was designed with security as a top priority
-   Formal Verification: Move allows developers to mathematically prove
    that their code is correct. This means you can be more certain that
    the code behaves as expected and is free from certain types of bugs.
-   Linear type system: Move's type system helps prevent many common
    vulnerabilities, like reentrancy attacks by making it easier to
    reason about how data is used and transferred.

### Benefits

-   High Assurance: The built-in features and formal verification system
    give developers strong tools to ensure their code is secure and
    correct.

## Solidity's Approach to Smart Contracts verification

### Key Features

-   Ecosystem Improvements: Solidity has improved significantly in
    recent years, with better tools for ensuring code correctness &
    security.
-   External Tools:
    -   Formal verification frameworks: These tools help verify to
        correctness of smart contracts
    -   Static analyzers & Linters: These tools scan the code to detect
        common vulnerabilities and coding issues.

### Benefits

-   Evolving ecosystem: The solidity community has developed various
    tools to improve security and verification, making it a viable
    option for secure smart contract development

## Comparison

### Built-in features & External Tools

-   Move: offers built-in formal verification & a type system that
    inherently supports secure coding practices.
-   Solidity: Relies on external tools & frameworks to achieve similar
    levels of verification & security

### Security Focus

-   Move: designed from the ground up with security in mind.
-   Solidity: Initially criticized for security issues but has made
    significant progress with new tools & practices

## Simple Analogy

### Move

-   Imagine you have a car with advanced, built-in safety features.
-   These features ensure that the car is secure and performs correctly
    without needing extra add-ons.

### Solidity

-   Imagine you have a car that started with basic safety features but
    over time has had many new safety tools & technologies added to it
    to improve its security
